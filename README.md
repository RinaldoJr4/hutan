# Hutan
App Developed in the fist challenge after the onboarding (Camaragibe) at the Apple Developers Academy | UFPE

It was such a fun experience, I've learned a lot in the Academy, here is some stuff I learned in while developing this app:
- Segues
- Timer
- Auto Layout
- WalkThrough
- Pet Caring

PS. I lost the last part of the code (I forgot to save, my last day of wor :(, so I lost the code of the LaunchScrean and te WalkThrough, but the main part of the app (Hutan News and Hutan Guide) still there.

PS.2. I also coudn't upload the assets in a folder so it's mixed in with the content
